# CLAUDE.md

Notes for future Claude sessions working on this directory. See `PLAN.md` for
the product spec and dataset schema — this file covers code conventions,
where logic lives, and common pitfalls.

## Keeping the docs in sync

This repo has overlapping documentation that must not drift apart:

- **`CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are byte-identical.** `AGENTS.md` is a verbatim
  mirror of `CLAUDE.md` (for agents that read `AGENTS.md`). After editing
  `CLAUDE.md`, mirror it: `cp CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md` (or edit both identically).
  Never let them diverge — a reviewer should be able to `diff CLAUDE.md
  AGENTS.md` and get no output.
- **`README.md` files are human-facing** and describe the same shared facts at
  a higher level: the root `README.md` (project overview, build/run, layout)
  plus per-directory `README.md`s in `_templates/`, `data/`, and `docs/`.
- **When you change a shared fact** — a build/run command, the directory
  layout, how datasets are added, a core convention — **update all the docs it
  appears in**: this file (then mirror to `AGENTS.md`), the relevant
  `README.md`(s), and `PLAN.md` if it's a schema change. The detailed
  conventions and pitfalls live here in `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`; the READMEs
  link here rather than duplicating the depth.

## What this is

A static system-design interview explorer. No framework, one CDN dep
(Mermaid v10). The pages have no bundler — the only "build" is a copy step
(`build.py`) that assembles deployable sites from sources into `docs/`.

Two pages, sharing `styles.css`:

- **`index.html` (overview)** — a visual grid of all interviews, organized into
  categories. Driven by `overview.js`. Each card shows an icon and links to the
  explorer via `interview.html#<datasetId>`.
- **`interview.html` (explorer)** — the per-interview step-by-step walkthrough.
  Driven by `interview.js` (one IIFE). This is the original single-page app.

> **"Group" is overloaded — watch out.** A *dataset group* is a top-level
> directory under `data/` (e.g. `examples`, `book`) that builds into one
> independent site `docs/<group>/`. A *category* is the `groups[]` array inside
> a single site's `index.json` (e.g. "Fundamentals", "Media & Search") — the
> sections the overview renders. The JSON key is `groups` for historical
> reasons; in prose we call those **categories**.

### Source layout (what you edit)

| Path                                | Role                                                     |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `_templates/index.html`             | Overview-page DOM shell (shared by every group)          |
| `_templates/overview.js`            | Overview-page behavior (one IIFE)                        |
| `_templates/interview.html`         | Explorer DOM shell + Mermaid CDN tag (shared)            |
| `_templates/interview.js`           | Explorer behavior (one IIFE, no modules)                 |
| `_templates/node-types.json`        | Canonical node types + external rendering config         |
| `_templates/styles.css`             | All styling, both pages (shared)                         |
| `_templates/icons/system-design.png`| Fallback interview icon (shared)                         |
| `data/<group>/index.json`           | One site's manifest (`groups[]` of categories)           |
| `data/<group>/<id>/interview.json`  | One dataset per subdirectory                             |
| `data/<group>/<id>/icon.png`        | Optional per-interview icon (else falls back)            |
| `data/<group>/<id>/assets/`         | Optional generated icons/images linked from JSON         |
| `_scripts/generate_interview_assets.py` | Generates interview assets and writes JSON links     |

Datasets are organized into **groups** (each a directory under `data/`).
`data/examples/` is the canonical group of worked examples; `data/book/` is the
book group (a pattern catalog + flagship cases like `payment-system` and
`notification-system`, plus `BOOK-STRUCTURE.md` as a planning note). A group is
publishable once it has an `index.json` manifest.

### Build output (generated — never hand-edit)

`build.py` produces one independent, deployable site per publishable group:

| Path                                | Role                                                     |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `docs/<group>/`                     | Copy of the whole `_templates/` tree (pages, js, css, `node-types.json`, `icons/`) |
| `docs/<group>/data/index.json`      | Copy of `data/<group>/index.json`                        |
| `docs/<group>/data/<id>/...`        | Copy of each dataset subdir (incl. any `icon.png`)       |

`docs/` is **committed** (GitHub Pages deploys from the `/docs` folder). After
changing anything in `_templates/` or `data/`, re-run `build.py` and commit the
regenerated `docs/`.

**Generated AI images are huge; downscale them as a separate step before
deploying.** The full-resolution originals under
`data/<group>/<id>/assets/generated/` are ~1500–3000px tall, but the explorer
only ever shows them in a `.diagram-image` box capped at `max-height: 560px`.
Shipping the originals pushes `docs/` past GitHub Pages' size limit. **`build.py`
does NOT touch image sizes** — it's a pure copy step. A separate script,
**`downsize-images.py`**, shrinks the generated images in a built `docs/` tree
in place to `DEFAULT_MAX_HEIGHT` (1120px = 2× the display height, for retina
sharpness), preserving aspect ratio and format. Run it **by hand on the built
tree, not on every build** (it's slow and lossy — you don't want to re-shrink
on every rebuild):

```bash
python3 build.py                  # 1. copy sources into docs/
python3 downsize-images.py docs/  # 2. shrink generated images across all groups
```

It searches each given directory **recursively at any depth** for
`assets/generated/{ai-visuals,design-vs-requirements}/` folders, so you can point
it at the whole `docs/` root (every group at once), a single group
(`docs/book`), or one dataset (`docs/book/data/foo`). **Comics are left at full
size** (long vertical strips read full-size, not in the 560px box). It rewrites
only the `docs/` copies; the originals in `data/` are never modified (so you can
re-run `build.py` to restore full-res, then re-downsize). It's idempotent
(already-small images are skipped), so a second pass is a safe no-op — but run
**one pass at a time**: two concurrent passes over the same tree make the
backends race on the same files (the source of spurious `sips` "exit status 13"
failures). Flags: `--max-height N`, `--backend sips|pillow`, and it accepts
multiple dirs. To change the default cap or scope, edit the constants near the
top of `downsize-images.py`.

`downsize-images.py` prefers macOS **`sips`** (no install, ships with the OS) and
falls back to **Pillow** (cross-platform; pinned in `requirements.txt` —
`pip install -r requirements.txt`); if neither is present it prints a notice and
changes nothing. `build.py` itself has **no third-party dependencies**.

## Building

```bash
python3 build.py            # rebuild every publishable group into docs/
python3 build.py examples   # rebuild only the named group(s)
```

`build.py` is a pure copy step with no third-party dependencies; it does not
resize images (that's the separate `downsize-images.py` step described under
"Build output" above).

The script wipes and regenerates each `docs/<group>/`, so removed or renamed
datasets don't linger. Groups without an `index.json` are skipped with a
notice. Loose files at a group root that aren't dataset directories (e.g.
`data/book/BOOK-STRUCTURE.md`, `data/book/_buildlib.py`) are not copied — only
`index.json` and dataset subdirectories ship. Within a dataset directory,
authoring/review notes, source briefs, and build helpers (`*.md`, `*.py`,
`*.mjs`, `*.pdf` — see `NON_DATA_SUFFIXES`) are skipped too, so `interview.json`
(and assets like `icon.png`) ship but `INPUT.md` / `INPUT.pdf` / `REVIEW.md` /
`_build.py` stay repo-only.
Developer `README.md`s in `_templates/` are likewise skipped from the template
copy (`_ignore_template_docs`), so they don't ship into `docs/<group>/`. The
`docs/README.md` at the `docs/` root is not touched by the build (only
`docs/<group>/` subdirs are regenerated).

## Running locally

Serve a built group from `docs/`:

```bash
python3 build.py                       # ensure docs/ is current
python3 -m http.server 8000 -d docs    # serve the docs/ tree
# visit http://localhost:8000/examples/            (overview = index.html)
# explorer is http://localhost:8000/examples/interview.html#url-shortener
```

The app fetches JSON, so `file://` does not work — always serve. Note you
serve the *built* output (`docs/<group>/`), not `_templates/`; the templates
have no sibling `data/` directory of their own.

## Verification you can do without a browser

The user usually can't see browser-side rendering from your sandbox. Use:

```bash
node --check _templates/interview.js                            # explorer JS
node --check _templates/overview.js                             # overview JS
python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('data/examples/...'))"  # JSON validity
python3 build.py                                                # copy step itself
```

Edit the sources in `_templates/` (`interview.js`, `overview.js`, …), not the
`docs/<group>/` copies — those are overwritten on the next build.

For dataset edits, cross-check that `view.highlight` IDs appear in that view's
`nodes`, `view.links` references resolve to `highLevelArchitecture.links`, and
sequence participants reference canonical node IDs or aliases. Also verify that
`satisfies[*].steps[*]` slugs resolve to real step IDs. Raw Mermaid source only
remains for requirements/capacity overview sketches and ER data-model diagrams;
if you change those, say explicitly that Mermaid rendering still needs visual
validation.

HTTP-serve check (`python3 build.py`, start `python3 -m http.server -d docs` in
the background, curl each asset under `/examples/` for 200, stop server) is fast
and worth doing after large edits.

## interview.js structure

The explorer (`interview.js`). One IIFE. Top to bottom:

1. **Mermaid init** — `securityLevel: 'strict'`. Don't change unless you need
   clickable nodes inside diagrams.
2. **`els`** — cached `document.getElementById` refs. All DOM access goes
   through this object.
3. **`state`** — current dataset, entries list, indices.
4. **`INTRO_SLUGS` / `WRAPUP_ORDER` / `WRAPUP_SLUGS`** — sidebar wiring. New
   intro sections must be registered here.
5. **Utilities** — `fetchJson`, structured graph/sequence helpers,
   `resolveHighlights`, `augmentDiagramWithHighlights`, sentence splitter.
6. **`buildEntries(data)`** — turns a dataset into a flat list of `{ kind,
   id, title, payload }` items in sidebar order (intros, then steps, then
   wrap-up intros). The order here matters: it's exactly the display order.
7. **`renderNav` / `updateNavActive`** — renders the three sidebar groups
   (`Overview`, `Architecture`, `Wrap-up`). Groups are populated by
   filtering `INTRO_SLUGS` membership in `WRAPUP_SLUGS`. `renderNav` also
   appends a **Settings** section (`renderSettings`) pinned at the bottom of
   the sidebar — see "Settings" below.
8. **Step rendering** — `effectiveDiagramFor`, `renderDiagram`,
   `renderOptionTabs`, `renderProsCons`, `renderStepExtras`. The diagram
   highlight pipeline is described below.
9. **Intro renderers** — `renderIntroRequirements`, `renderIntroCapacity`,
   `renderIntroApi`, `renderIntroDataModel`, `renderIntroTradeoffs`,
   `renderIntroConcepts`, `renderIntroPatternCatalog`,
   `renderIntroApiFlows`, `renderIntroSatisfies`, `renderIntroInterviewScript`,
   `renderIntroLevelVariants`, `renderIntroFollowUps`,
   `renderIntroStepsOverview` (the decision-tree map). Each returns a DOM node;
   `renderIntroEntry()` dispatches by slug. (`renderTraps` and
   `renderStepTradeoffs` are per-step, appended in `renderStepExtras`.)
10. **`renderCurrentEntry()`** — top-level rendering. Shows/hides
    `#diagram-block` vs `#intro-block` based on `entry.kind`.
11. **Navigation** — `selectEntry`, `selectOption`, `updateHash`, `parseHash`.
12. **Dataset loading** — `validateDataset`, `normalizeManifest`,
    `loadDataset`, `init`. `normalizeManifest` accepts the grouped manifest
    (`groups[]`), returning a flat `datasets` list (each tagged with
    `groupId`/`groupName`) plus the `groups`. The explorer has **no dataset
    picker** — you reach an interview from the overview or via the
    `#<datasetId>/<entryId>` hash; the explorer only switches datasets in
    response to a hash change.
13. **Event wiring** — buttons, arrow keys, `hashchange`.

The overview page (`overview.js`) is a separate, much smaller IIFE: fetch
`data/index.json`, `normalizeGroups()` (same grouped-manifest logic), render one
`.group-section` per category with a grid of `.interview-card`s. It shares no
code with `interview.js` — keep the two manifest normalizers in sync by hand.

## Node Types

Canonical architecture node types live in `_templates/node-types.json`, not in
renderer name heuristics. `interview.js` loads that file and uses
`rendering.types[type]` for Mermaid shape, fill, stroke, text color, and class
name. Keep shapes/colors there; only use `view.nodes[].render.shape` as a local
escape hatch.

Current canonical types are: `actor`, `client`, `edge`, `gateway`, `service`,
`orchestrator`, `worker`, `queue`, `stream`, `cache`, `database`,
`object-storage`, `index`, `model`, `observability`, and `external`.

Use `actor` only for human or organization roles: user, buyer, driver,
merchant, operator, admin, creator, viewer. Use `client` for software outside
the backend boundary: browser, mobile app, SDK, admin portal, dashboard,
producer app, consumer app, device app, or upstream caller software.

## Highlight pipeline (the subtle part)

There are **two paths** depending on diagram type, because Mermaid's
sequence-diagram parser rejects the `classDef`/`class` syntax used for
flowcharts. Don't try to unify them.

### Flowcharts (generated architecture views)

Architecture steps, options, deep dives, and final designs are authored as
structured `view` objects. Do not add raw Mermaid `diagram` fields there; the
validator rejects them. The renderer generates Mermaid from
`highLevelArchitecture.nodes`, `highLevelArchitecture.links`, and
`highLevelArchitecture.types`.

Connections in these generated diagrams are drawn as **plain lines without
arrowheads**: `graphLinkLine` runs every link's arrow token through
`stripLinkArrowheads`, which keeps the line style (solid `---` / dotted `-.-`)
and approximate length but removes the arrowhead. So a link's `render.arrow`
still controls solid-vs-dotted, but never the arrowhead. (The decision-tree map
is built separately in `buildDecisionTreeMermaid` and keeps its directed
arrows.)

1. `effectiveDiagramFor(step)` generates Mermaid from `view.nodes` /
   `view.links`, accounting for `options` if present.
2. For auto-diff, the previous step's default-option view is generated and
   compared to the current generated view.
3. `resolveHighlights()` returns explicit `view.highlight` if present, else
   the diff of node IDs.
4. `augmentDiagramWithHighlights()` appends `classDef newNode ...` and
   `class A,B,C newNode` to the Mermaid source before render.
5. CSS in `styles.css` (`.node.newNode > rect|polygon|…`) targets the
   rendered SVG. Mermaid's class assignment ends up on the `.node` group.

**Layout direction is forced at render time, not authored.**
`forceFlowchartDirection(src, dir)` rewrites the `graph`/`flowchart` header:
requirements + capacity diagrams → `LR`. For generated architecture views
(`renderDiagram`, which serves both steps and the `final-design` intro entry)
the direction is `state.diagramDirection` — `TB` by default but user-togglable
to `LR` (see "Interactive diagram controls" below). It only touches flowcharts
— sequence/ER sources pass through.

**Interactive diagram controls (steps + final design only).** Each generated
architecture diagram renders in a two-column row (`#diagram-layout`): the
diagram fills the left, and a fixed-width right column (`#diagram-controls`,
built by `renderDiagramControls(nodes)`) holds a TB/LR layout switch on top and
a vertical checkbox list of nodes, with a "Download SVG" action beneath the
list. (The controls are the *second* flex child, so they sit on the right.)
- `flowchartNodeList(src)` extracts the ordered node list (id + label) from the
  *unfiltered* generated source, so every node has a checkbox even when hidden.
- Unchecking a node adds its id to `state.hiddenNodes`;
  `filterFlowchartNodes(src, hidden)` then drops that node's definition line and
  every edge touching it (handles the arrowless `---`/`-.-` connectors via
  `FLOWCHART_EDGE_RE`). Highlights are intersected with the visible set before
  `augmentDiagramWithHighlights` so we never `class` a removed node.
- The TB/LR buttons set `state.diagramDirection`.
- "Download SVG" (`downloadDiagramSvg`) serializes the rendered `#diagram` SVG
  (reflecting the current toggles/direction) to a downloadable file named from
  the entry title.
- Both `state.hiddenNodes` and `state.diagramDirection` are **per-diagram**:
  `resetDiagramInteractivity()` clears them (back to all-visible / `TB`) on every
  entry, option, and diagram-view change. Any control change calls
  `renderCurrentEntry()` to re-render.
- These controls do **not** apply to flow (sequence) diagrams or the
  requirements/capacity/decision-tree diagrams.

Requirements and capacity diagrams are raw overview Mermaid arrays rendered as
authored, with `annotateNodeTypes: false`. Do not inject HTML type captions into
them: metric labels such as `~1k creates/sec` and multiline capacity labels can
break Mermaid parsing when wrapped in inline HTML.

### Sequence diagrams (per-step `flows[]`)

1. `flowParticipantIds()` reads participant IDs from the structured
   `sequence.participants` and `sequence.messages` data, including aliases.
2. `resolveFlowHighlights(flow, currentStep, allStepsBefore)`:
   - Explicit `flow.highlight` wins (filtered to participants that actually
     appear in this flow).
   - Otherwise union of: participants new to this step (not present in any
     earlier step's flows) + IDs from `currentStep.view.highlight` that match a
     participant in this flow (inheritance from the main diagram).
3. **Do NOT** mutate the Mermaid source — the sequence parser rejects
   `classDef`. Instead pass the highlight list to `makeMermaidEl()` via
   `opts = { highlightParticipants, sourceForLabels, annotateParticipants }`.
4. After Mermaid resolves, `applySequenceHighlights()` walks the rendered
   SVG, finds `<text>` elements whose textContent matches a participant
   label (resolved via `parseSequenceParticipantLabels`), and adds the
   `newNode` class to that `<text>` plus the matching participant `<rect>`.
5. CSS selectors that target this path: `rect.newNode`, `text.newNode`,
   plus the `.actor.newNode` family emitted by Mermaid sequence SVGs. This
   `.actor` class is Mermaid's participant class, not the canonical `actor`
   node type. Keep these selectors alongside the flowchart selectors.

### Debugging

If a step diagram highlight breaks visually:
1. Does the node ID match the highlight ID character-for-character?
2. Is the `classDef` line being appended (log `src` in `renderDiagram`)?
3. Did Mermaid emit the class on the SVG `<g class="node …">`?

If a flow diagram highlight breaks:
1. Does `sequence.participants` include the canonical node id or alias used by
   the highlight?
2. Does the visible label match what `parseSequenceParticipantLabels`
   resolved? Mermaid renders the `as <label>` value, not the bare ID.
3. Did `applySequenceHighlights` find a matching `<text>` element in the
   SVG? Mermaid version drift can change SVG structure — broaden the
   selector if needed.

## Mermaid render helper

`makeMermaidEl(diagramSrc, className, opts)` returns a container div and kicks
off `mermaid.render()` asynchronously with a unique id. On render failure
it shows an inline error block under that one diagram instead of crashing
the page. Use it for any *new* Mermaid diagram outside the main step diagram.
The step diagram uses `renderDiagram()` because it needs the highlight pipeline
above.

For flowcharts, `makeMermaidEl()` annotates node labels/types by default. Pass
`{ annotateNodeTypes: false }` for raw overview diagrams such as
`requirementsDiagram` and `capacityDiagram`; those should remain simple Mermaid
source with no injected HTML labels. For sequence diagrams, pass
`highlightParticipants`, `sourceForLabels`, and `annotateParticipants` so the
rendered SVG can be patched after Mermaid finishes. Pass
`{ onRendered(targetEl) }` for a generic post-render hook on the finished SVG —
used by the Decision Tree to attach node click handlers (see above).

Mermaid render IDs must be unique per page render. We use a monotonically
incrementing `mermaidIdSeq` plus `Date.now()`. Don't reuse IDs.

## Sidebar grouping conventions

There are exactly three groups: **Overview**, **Architecture**, **Wrap-up**.

- Architecture is `entries.filter(e => e.kind === 'step' ||
  ARCHITECTURE_INTRO_SLUGS.has(e.id))` — i.e. all steps **plus** the
  architecture intro entry (`final-design`).
- Wrap-up is `entries with id in WRAPUP_SLUGS`, ordered by `WRAPUP_ORDER`.
- Overview is everything else among intros.

To move a section between Overview and Wrap-up, add/remove its slug from
`WRAPUP_SLUGS` and adjust `WRAPUP_ORDER`. The builder still pushes intros
to the same `entries` array; the grouping is purely a render-time filter.

### Settings section (pinned at the sidebar bottom)

Below the three nav groups, `renderSettings()` appends a `.nav-settings`
block (CSS `margin-top: auto` pins it to the bottom; `.nav-list` is a flex
column with `min-height: 100%`). It currently holds one preference,
**Default visual**, a `<select>` of `Diagram` / `Alternative Visual
(AI-generated)`.

The preference lives in `state.defaultVisual` (`"diagram" | "ai"`), persisted
to `localStorage` under `SETTINGS_KEY` via `loadSettings` / `saveSettings`
(loaded in `init`). It seeds the per-entry `state.visualMode` (reset in
`selectEntry`/`loadDataset` to `state.defaultVisual` instead of hardcoded
`"diagram"`) and the local default of the intro `makeVisualSwitcher`
(requirements/capacity). It only has a visible effect where an AI visual
actually exists for the entry — `renderVisualTabs(false)` still falls the
mode back to `diagram` when there's no visual. Changing it
(`setDefaultVisual`) persists, snaps the current `visualMode`, and
re-renders. To add another setting, extend `renderSettings` and the
`SETTINGS_KEY` payload.

### Steps Overview / Decision Tree (auto-generated Wrap-up entry)

> The architecture intro entry is labelled **"Final Design"** in the UI (the
> sidebar nav and the page heading). It is pushed **after** the steps in
> `buildEntries`, so it is the **last** item in the High-Level Architecture
> sidebar group. The internal slug stays `final-design`
> (`INTRO_SLUGS.finalDesign`) and the dataset field stays `finalDesign` — only
> the display string and ordering changed. A dataset's `finalDesign.title` is
> not displayed.

The decision-tree map of the whole interview lives in its own **Wrap-up entry
titled "Steps Overview"** (slug `steps-overview`, `INTRO_SLUGS.stepsOverview`),
rendered first in `WRAPUP_ORDER`. The entry is added in `buildEntries` only when
the dataset has `steps[]` (its payload is `null` — the tree is derived from
`state.data`, not the payload). `renderIntroStepsOverview()` returns the DOM
node (an intro renderer dispatched from `renderIntroEntry`), so the tree renders
into `#intro-block` like any other Wrap-up section. It no longer lives above the
Final Design diagram.

The tree maps the journey as a flowchart: each top-level step is a node, the
**first** (default/chosen) option labels the spine edge to the next step, and
the remaining options become dashed-`alt` side-branch leaves. Sub-steps
(`step.parent`) branch off their parent via a dashed-`sub` edge instead of
sitting on the spine. The spine ends at a **Final Design** node. It is **fully
derived** from `steps[]`/`options`/`finalDesign` — nothing is authored per
dataset — and reads `state.data`.

`buildDecisionTreeMermaid(data)` returns `{ source, nodeTargets }` where
`nodeTargets` maps each synthetic Mermaid id (`dtStep<i>`, `dtStep<i>Opt<o>`,
`dtFinal`) to an entry index. Because Mermaid runs at `securityLevel: 'strict'`
(its own `click` directive is sanitized away), clicks are wired **after** render
via the `makeMermaidEl(..., { onRendered })` hook: `wireDecisionTreeClicks`
walks `g.node` elements, recovers the node id from Mermaid's
`flowchart-<id>-<n>` group id, and attaches a `selectEntry` listener (clicking
any node — including the `dtFinal` node — jumps to that entry). If a future
Mermaid upgrade changes that group-id format, update the regex in
`wireDecisionTreeClicks`.

### Sub-steps (`step.parent`)

A step can declare `parent: "<other-step-id>"`. In the sidebar it renders
with the `nav-item-child` class — indented and prefixed with `↳`. It is
still a normal entry: arrow keys, hash routing, highlight pipeline, and
the flow-diff "previous step" lookup all treat it like any other step.
This is for genuinely smaller scope work — e.g. "3a. Choose the Algorithm"
under "3. Centralized Counter Store" in the rate-limiter dataset. The
parent must reference an existing step id; unknown parents are ignored.

## CSS conventions

- Custom properties at `:root` for the palette (`--accent`, `--highlight`,
  `--border`, …). Use those instead of literal colors.
- Card pattern: `background: var(--panel); border: 1px solid var(--border);
  border-radius: 6px; padding: 10px 14px;`. Used by deep-dive cards,
  proscons columns, API cards, schema cards, satisfies cards, flow cards.
- The `.overview-diagram` class is the base for all intro Mermaid diagrams;
  modifier classes (`.api-diagram`, `.flow-diagram`) override via the
  `.overview-diagram.<modifier>` compound selector — bare modifier selectors
  lose specificity to the base.
- `.bullets`, `.mono`, `.muted` are used widely as small utilities.

## Book-feature fields

Optional fields exist for the `book` group's pedagogy (all degrade to nothing
when absent, so the `examples` datasets are unaffected):

- `step.tradeoffs` → per-step "Trade-offs" cards **and** a derived Overview
  "Trade-offs" entry (deduped across steps via `collectDatasetTradeoffs`, same
  mechanics as Concepts: grouped by `group` or the step's title, with step
  chips). Each `{ name, description, chosen?, icon?, group? }` — `name` is a
  short tension label ("Latency vs. freshness"), `description` explains the
  tension, `chosen` states what this design picks and why. The shared fallback
  icon is `icons/decision-point.png`. **The old `patterns` (dataset) and
  `step.patterns` fields were removed and are rejected by `validateDataset`** —
  pattern vocabulary now lives in `step.concepts`, pattern decisions in
  `step.tradeoffs` (the `patternCatalog` reference dataset is unaffected).
- `step.traps` → per-step "Common traps" section. Each `{ trap, why?, instead? }`.
- `technologyChoices` (dataset) → Wrap-up "Technology Choices" entry (between
  Design vs. Requirements and API Flows). Each is one architecture concern:
  `{ concern, steps?, selfHosted[], cloud:{ aws[], gcp[], azure[] }, tradeoff?,
  makesIrrelevant? }` — self-hosted vs cloud-native/SaaS options by provider, a
  self-host-vs-managed trade-off, and a note on what a given choice can make
  unnecessary (e.g. a managed autoscaling DB removing the need to hand-shard).
  `tradeoff` and `makesIrrelevant` are each a string **or** an array of strings;
  both render as a bulleted list under a label (a string is sentence-split into
  bullets via `bulletsFrom`, so prefer an array for clean, deliberate bullets).
  `steps[]` cross-links to the steps it relates to (clickable chips). Each tech
  chip in `selfHosted`/`cloud.*` is a bare string **or** `{ name, icon }`, where
  `icon` is a dataset-relative path shown to the left of the name.
  `_scripts/assign_tech_icons.py <interview.json>` assigns those icons from a
  curated mapping in **`_media/index.yaml`** (a list of `{ icon, terms }`;
  terms match case-insensitively, with parenthetical qualifiers stripped, a
  longest-leading-prefix fallback, and a `/`-segment fallback so "IPVS/LVS",
  "Aurora (PostgreSQL/MySQL)", etc. resolve). It copies each matched icon (or
  `_media/tech.png` for unmatched terms) into `<interview>/assets/tech-icons/`,
  rewrites the chips to `{ name, icon }`, and keeps **`_media/missing.yaml`** in
  sync as the list of **every term that uses the `tech.png` fallback** (no match,
  family-rejected, or mapped file absent) — adding new fallbacks and pruning
  terms that now resolve. **Provider rule (enforced):** an AWS-column chip may
  only use an icon under `aws-icons/`, GCP only `gcp-icons/` (per-category
  icons), Azure only `azure-icons/` (per-service SVGs); a cross-family mapping
  is rejected and falls back to `tech.png`. Self-hosted chips may use any
  directory (usually `general-icons/`). To fix a chip's icon, edit
  `_media/index.yaml` (and remove the term from `missing.yaml`) and re-run.
- `interviewScript` (dataset) → Wrap-up "Interview Script" entry. Each
  `{ phase, time?, say }` (`say` is a string or array).
- `levelVariants` (dataset) → Wrap-up "By Level" entry. Each
  `{ level, expectations }`.
- `patternCatalog` (dataset) → standalone "Pattern Catalog" entry, grouped by
  `category`. Each `{ name, category?, what, whenToUse?, tradeoffs?, aliases?,
  pairsWith?, commonlyConfusedWith?, usedBy? }`. **A dataset with
  `patternCatalog` and no `steps` is valid** (a catalog, not a walkthrough) —
  `validateDataset` requires `steps[]` *or* `patternCatalog[]`. The catalog name
  is the **canonical vocabulary**: `aliases[]` lists case-study synonyms
  that map to it (rendered as "Also called" chips), and `pairsWith[]` /
  `commonlyConfusedWith[]` are other catalog names rendered as relationship chips
  ("Pairs with" / "Confused with") — keep those references pointing at real
  catalog `name`s. `usedBy[]` entries are either a free-text case name (string)
  **or** an object `{ datasetId, label }`; a `datasetId` turns the chip into a
  link to that case study (`#<datasetId>`), so it must resolve in the group's
  `index.json`.
- Generated visual assets are optional and path-based, relative to the dataset
  directory. Top-level `assets` stores `icon`; pattern/concept objects use
  `icon` (small inline icons). **AI Visuals** are full diagram-replacement
  images: `aiVisual` (a string path) lives on each `step`, each step/finalDesign
  `option`, and `finalDesign`; the requirements/capacity visuals live in a
  top-level `aiVisuals: { requirements, capacity }`. When present, the explorer
  shows a **Diagram | AI Visual** tab strip above the diagram that flips between
  the Mermaid diagram and the generated image (for steps/final design the visual
  follows the selected option; for requirements/capacity it's a self-contained
  toggle in the intro section). `_scripts/generate_diagram_picture.py` generates
  these (one image per option) under `assets/generated/ai-visuals/` and writes
  the `aiVisual`/`aiVisuals` paths back into `interview.json`. (The old
  final-design-only `finalDesign.image` field was removed.)
- **Design-vs-Requirements illustrations**: each `satisfies.functional[]` and
  `satisfies.nonFunctional[]` item may carry its own optional `aiVisual` (a
  string path) — a per-requirement illustration of *how the design meets that
  requirement*, rendered inline (click-to-open-full-size) inside that
  requirement's card in the Wrap-up **"Design vs. Requirements"** entry. Unlike
  the AI Visuals above there is **no Diagram|AI Visual toggle** — it always
  shows when present and renders nothing when absent.
  `_scripts/generate_design_vs_requirements_pictures.py` generates one image per
  requirement (built from the item's `requirement`/`how`/`steps`) under
  `assets/generated/design-vs-requirements/` and writes the
  `satisfies.<column>[<i>].aiVisual` paths back into `interview.json`
  (`--include functional|nonFunctional`, `--force`, `--dry-run` like the diagram
  script). It does not rebuild `docs/`.
- `explainerComic` (dataset, string path) → Wrap-up **"Explainer Comic"** entry,
  rendered **first** in the Wrap-up group (it leads `WRAPUP_ORDER`). A single
  generated comic-strip image summarizing the whole interview, shown full-width
  with a click-to-open-full-size link. `_scripts/generate_interview_comic.py`
  generates the image under `assets/generated/comic/` and writes the
  dataset-relative `explainerComic` path back into `interview.json` (on a fresh
  generation, or when it finds an existing image and just wires up the field;
  `--force` regenerates, `--no-write-json` skips the write, `--dry-run` never
  touches the JSON).

`data/book/payment-system` is the reference dataset using the per-step/wrap-up
fields; `data/book/notification-system` is a second full case;
`data/book/patterns` is the catalog dataset (no steps, `patternCatalog` only).
`url-shortener` carries a smaller sample (`interviewScript`,
`levelVariants`, and `traps` on the cache step).

The `book` group's categories live in `data/book/index.json`: Reference (the
catalog), Messaging & Real-Time, Financial Systems — growing one flagship case
per family. Foundational/social families are intentionally left to `examples`.

## Common pitfalls

- **Keep Bash commands simple to avoid safety-classifier approval prompts.**
  These classifiers run regardless of permission allow-rules, so settings can't
  silence them — only command *shape* can. The recurring offenders here:
  - *"expansion obfuscation"* — heredocs, `$(cat <<EOF)`, inline `node -` /
    `python3 -` scripts, brace+quote one-liners.
  - *"cd with write operation"* — `cd /path && <write cmd>`.
  - *"simple_expansion"* — bare shell vars like `kill $SRV`, `... $url`.

  Conventions that sidestep all three (writes in this repo are auto-approved, so
  files are free):
  - Put real logic in a **helper script file** (`*.mjs`/`*.py`) and run it with
    an absolute path; delete it after. Don't inline scripts via heredoc.
  - **No `cd`** — the Bash cwd persists across calls; use absolute paths or tool
    flags (`git -C <repo> …`, `python3 /abs/build.py`, `rm /abs/file`).
  - Write commit messages to a temp file and `git commit -F <file>` (not
    `-m "$(… <<EOF)"`). Quote any unavoidable shell variables (`"$url"`).
- **Editing `interview.json`**: it's a single big JSON object. Use small
  targeted `Edit` ops rather than `Write`-ing the whole file; that's easier
  to review and less likely to drop fields. After every edit, validate with
  `python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('...'))"`.
- **Mermaid node IDs**: must be `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_-]*`. The highlight
  regex filter drops anything that doesn't match. If you use a node id with
  a space, slash, or dot, it won't highlight.
- **Architecture diagrams are structured now**: do not add `diagram` to
  `steps[]`, `step.options[]`, `step.deepDives[]`, `finalDesign`, or
  `finalDesign.options[]`. Use `view.nodes`, `view.links`, optional
  `view.groups`, optional `view.highlight`, and optional `view.caption` (a
  one-line description of what that diagram shows, rendered under the diagram).
- **Flow diagrams are structured now**: do not add raw Mermaid sequence
  `diagram` fields. Use `sequence.participants` and `sequence.messages` for
  `step.flows[]`, `finalDesign.flows[]`, and `api[].sequence`.
- **Node type styling is external**: add or adjust canonical types and
  shapes/colors in `_templates/node-types.json`, not by inferring names in
  `interview.js`. Keep `actor` for people/organizations and `client` for
  software caller surfaces.
- **erDiagram type tokens**: must be a bare identifier (no spaces, no
  punctuation). `autoErDiagramFromDataModel()` sanitizes this — if you write
  an explicit `dataModelDiagram`, do the sanitization yourself.
- **Sentence splitter and abbreviations**: descriptions split into bullets
  on `. ` followed by capital/digit. Common abbreviations (`e.g.`, `i.e.`,
  `etc.`, etc.) are handled — add new ones to `ABBREVS` in
  `splitIntoSentences()` if you see bad splits.
- **Don't reintroduce flow diagrams to `renderIntroApi`**. Per-endpoint
  flows live in `renderIntroApiFlows` (the Wrap-up entry). The Overview
  API section is the contract only.
- **Adding a new dataset**: create it under `data/<group>/<id>/interview.json`
  and register it inside one of the `groups[]` categories in that group's
  `data/<group>/index.json` (`{ id, name, path }`), otherwise it won't appear in
  the overview (or be reachable in the explorer). Optionally drop a `data/<group>/<id>/icon.png`
  for the overview card (else it falls back to `icons/system-design.png`). Then
  re-run `python3 build.py` and commit `docs/`.
- **Manifest is grouped**: `index.json` is `{ groups: [{ id, name, datasets:
  [...] }] }`. Keep `interview.js` (`normalizeManifest`) and `overview.js`
  (`normalizeGroups`) aligned on that shape.
- **Editing the wrong copy**: edit sources (`_templates/`, `data/<group>/`),
  never the generated `docs/<group>/` copies — the next build overwrites them.
- **Forgetting to rebuild**: changes to `_templates/` or `data/` are invisible
  on the deployed site until `build.py` regenerates `docs/` and you commit it.

## When the user asks for a small UI tweak

The instinct is to start a long task list. Don't. For a one-file or
two-file tweak (e.g. "make the bullets denser", "swap two columns"),
just make the edit and confirm. Task tracking is worth it when there are
≥3 distinct steps that span both JSON content and code.

## When the user changes the schema

If a new optional field is added to the schema:
1. Update `PLAN.md` with the new field in the schema block.
2. If it needs validation, add a check in `validateDataset()`.
3. Write the renderer; wire it in (`_templates/interview.js`).
4. Add styling in `_templates/styles.css`.
5. Add sample content to `data/examples/url-shortener/interview.json` so the
   feature is visible immediately (this is the canonical "worked example"
   dataset).
6. Re-run `python3 build.py` and commit the regenerated `docs/`.
