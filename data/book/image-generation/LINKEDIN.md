Today's Spec-Driven System Design Interview: Image Generation Platform — System Design.

The hard part is not the prompt box. It is turning scarce GPU seconds into a fair, safe, reliable product.

This walkthrough starts with the tempting synchronous design: the API receives a prompt, calls the diffusion model, waits, and returns an image. That works for a demo and breaks in production. Requests hold connections for seconds, bursts exhaust the GPU pool, free-tier traffic can crowd out paid users, and safety must run before and after generation.

The design then builds the production shape step by step: async intake, durable job state, transactional outbox, per-tier queues, GPU-second fair-share scheduling, compatible batching by model/version/size, safety gates, object storage, signed CDN URLs, and notifications backed by status replay.

The useful interview lesson: with AI systems, classic distributed-systems basics still carry the design. Idempotency, leases, DLQs, admission control, audit logs, and observability are what turn model serving into a product.

The technology choices make the trade-offs concrete: Triton, KServe, Ray Serve, TorchServe, or custom Diffusers workers for batching control; SageMaker, Vertex AI, Azure ML, Bedrock, Imagen, or Azure OpenAI image models for managed serving; SQS/Pub/Sub/Service Bus for dispatch; S3/GCS/Blob Storage plus CDN for delivery; managed or in-house safety classifiers for policy control.
