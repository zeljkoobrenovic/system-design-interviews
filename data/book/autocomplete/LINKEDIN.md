Today's Spec-Driven System Design Interview: Search Autocomplete — System Design.

Autocomplete looks simple until you remember that every keystroke is a query.

This case is useful because it moves one bottleneck at a time: start with `LIKE 'prefix%'` over a term table, then replace request-time scanning with a trie, then precompute top-k suggestions at each prefix node so the hot path is just "walk prefix, return list."

From there, the interview gets into the production details that make typeahead feel instant: edge and prefix caching for skewed short prefixes, streaming query events for minute-level freshness, versioned index rebuilds with atomic publish, typo tolerance, optional personalization, safety filtering, and adaptive prefix sharding for global traffic.

The lesson is not just "use a trie." The lesson is how to separate serving latency from ranking freshness. Reads stay simple and fast; writes, aggregation, rebuilds, and policy updates move into controlled background paths.

Modern technology choices make the trade-offs concrete: OpenSearch or Lucene suggesters can accelerate adoption, a custom compressed trie/FST can reduce serving footprint, CloudFront or Cloud CDN can absorb the hot head, Kafka/Kinesis/Pub/Sub can carry query events, and Flink/Dataflow-style aggregation can maintain rolling popularity counts. Those choices still leave cache keys, freshness windows, shard ownership, abuse controls, and rollback.
