Today's Spec-Driven System Design Interview: Distributed Key-Value Store — System Design.

A Dynamo-style KV store is where "just shard it" becomes a real distributed systems problem: key ownership, replica placement, accepted-write semantics, and convergence after partitions.

The walkthrough moves from one node to consistent hashing, virtual nodes, zone-aware replication, W/R quorums, vector clocks, tombstones, hinted handoff, Merkle-tree repair, gossip, rebalancing, backup, security, and observability.

Core lesson: availability is not a boolean. It is a consistency contract.

With N=3, W=2, R=2 gives read-your-writes and survives one replica down. W=1 keeps writes fast and available, but reads can be stale. Sloppy quorums keep the system writable during failures, but weaken quorum overlap and push conflict resolution into versioning and repair.

Technology choices make the trade-offs concrete. Cassandra, ScyllaDB, and Riak-style systems expose rings, repair, compaction, and quorum knobs. DynamoDB, Keyspaces, Bigtable, and Cosmos DB hide much of that behind managed APIs. CP systems like etcd, Spanner, or FoundationDB simplify ordering, but no longer match the "always writable" AP requirement.

Managed services remove a lot of ownership. They do not remove the fundamentals: partitioning, replica placement, quorum math, conflict handling, repair lag, hot-key controls, and foreground-latency metrics.
