Today's Spec-Driven System Design Interview: Agentic Legal Platform — System Design.

The hard part of legal AI is not sounding like a lawyer. It is proving every claim is grounded, current, confidential, and reviewed before it becomes work product.

This walkthrough starts with the tempting demo: draft from model memory. Then it turns that into deterministic retrieve -> draft -> verify -> attorney review. Hallucination is a first-class failure mode. A citation must exist, still be good law, and support its sentence. Failed citations loop back for correction or escalate; they do not quietly reach an attorney as "ready."

That makes the case useful system design practice because the constraints force real architecture choices: scoped retrieval from Westlaw/Practical Law/KeyCite and matter documents, ethical-wall enforcement from the first read, source-span provenance, immutable audit records, per-matter concurrency caps, and queue-based diligence work that does not starve interactive memos.

Modern implementations can map those fundamentals to managed edges with WAF and identity, search/RAG stacks such as OpenSearch or Azure AI Search, durable workflow engines like Temporal or Step Functions, managed queues, relational draft/review stores, model gateways, and caches/circuit breakers around citation providers. Managed services help, but the core gates remain: retrieval boundaries, citation verification, auditability, and licensed attorney approval.
