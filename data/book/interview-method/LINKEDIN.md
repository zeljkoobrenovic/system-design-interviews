Today's Spec-Driven System Design Interview: The System Design Interview Method.

The hard part of many system design interviews is not knowing whether Redis, Kafka, or DynamoDB exists. It is knowing when a choice is necessary, what it fixes, and what it costs.

This walkthrough turns the interview into a repeatable nine-phase method: clarify scope, estimate scale, define APIs, model data around access patterns, sketch the architecture, deep-dive the hard parts, name bottlenecks, cover reliability/security/cost/ops, and keep reasoning visible.

The practice value is the progression. A cache follows from read/write ratio, p99 latency, hot keys, and invalidation trade-offs. A queue or stream solves background work, retry, fanout, or replay, but changes read-after-write behavior. A store choice comes from transactions, partitions, access paths, consistency, and operational burden.

It also connects classic whiteboard moves to today's implementation options: API Gateway or Envoy at the edge, PostgreSQL or DynamoDB/Spanner/Cosmos DB for access-pattern fit, Redis/CDNs for hot reads, Kafka/SQS/Pub/Sub for async boundaries, Temporal/Step Functions for workflows, and managed observability when SLO evidence matters.

The goal is not a memorized script. It is to leave artifacts an interviewer can score: scope, estimates, API contract, data model, architecture, defended trade-offs, risk register, ops checklist, and a clear 60-second close.
