Today's Spec-Driven System Design Interview: Instagram — System Design.

The interesting part of an Instagram-style system is not "store photos and show a feed." It is learning where the simple version breaks.

This walkthrough starts with the naive design: upload media synchronously, serve it from the origin, and assemble the home feed on every read. That design is easy to explain, which makes it useful in an interview. It exposes the real pressure points: media processing blocks posting, global reads overwhelm origins, and querying every followee cannot hit a low-latency feed target.

From there, the design moves one bottleneck at a time: resumable object-store uploads, asynchronous processing queues, image/video variants, CDN delivery, hybrid fanout, ranking over a bounded candidate set, approximate counters, and rebuildable feed caches. The lesson is broader than Instagram: separate durable source-of-truth data from derived read models, and make every expensive path asynchronous, bounded, or cacheable.

The technology choices make the trade-offs concrete. You can discuss S3 or Cloud Storage behind a CDN for media, Kafka/SQS/Pub/Sub for processing and fanout, Redis or DynamoDB-style stores for feed lists, and SageMaker/Vertex/KServe-style serving for ranking. The point is not to memorize products. It is to connect each product choice back to the design pressure it relieves and the operational cost it introduces.
