Today's Spec-Driven System Design Interview: Agentic Public Benefits Platform — System Design.

The hard part of AI in public benefits is not reading forms faster. It is proving that an automated pipeline cannot quietly deny someone benefits they are legally entitled to contest.

This walkthrough starts with the tempting version: an agent reads an application, applies what it found, and approves or denies the case. Then it rebuilds around due process: effective-dated, jurisdiction-tagged rules; a deterministic rule engine; evidence provenance; every adverse determination routed to an accountable caseworker; and an appeal-ready record.

The core lesson: agents can help extract evidence and explain decisions, but they cannot be the legal decision-maker.

The rule engine produces a reproducible determination. The caseworker owns every adverse outcome. The notice explains the rules and evidence in plain language. The applicant can appeal from a complete record. At population scale, fairness monitoring looks for inconsistent treatment across groups and caseworkers.

The technology choices make the trade-offs concrete: API gateways and WAFs for admission control during open-enrollment surges; Textract, Document AI, Azure AI Document Intelligence, Tika, or OCR for intake; PostgreSQL, OpenSearch, Git, or managed search and database services for the versioned rule corpus; DMN engines, OPA, Lambda, Cloud Run, or Functions for governed rule packages; Temporal, Camunda, Step Functions, queues, and durable workflows for evidence waits, adverse-review SLAs, and appeal clocks; plus identity brokers, KMS/Key Vault, and PII controls for accountable scoped decisions.

The tools can change. The invariant should not: public benefits automation must make the record clearer, not make power harder to challenge.
